# You shall know the Truth

God is not a man His Word will surely come to pass

Jesus is the only Truth that reveals every Truth

Good things comes to those that patiently wait for upon the Lord Jesus

God can do it again. And again, and again 

No body can fight against God the Creator

In all you do acknowledge God always

What a Mighty God we serve

Christ Jesus is my foundation

Glory be to God in the Highest

In a great man's house, there are many vessels

His name is Yes and Amen
